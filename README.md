# prj-lyt
A project to provide .lyt files for people who bought un-supported 3D files.

Project Lychee Slicer Light Scene

The goal of this project is to provide .lyt files for miniature resin printing with the slicer Lychee.

Files of the format .lyt have the information of where supports are placed and what file was being supported,
but do NOT include the file itself. Upon opening a .lyt file you will be asked to point to the file(s) for
that miniature so they can be loaded. So you will need your own bought copy/version of the model itself.

These files only provide the support-info for the files.

File of the type .lys include both the support data and the .stl data and would not be legal to spread.

All files are supported by the community and do not guarantee any success. This is a "as is"-type of service.
Some of the files have been tested as the person providing it have printed the model themselves, some might
be supported and provided as a "educated guess"-scenario.

Where possible there will be a note if the file(s) are test-printed, on what printer and so on.
